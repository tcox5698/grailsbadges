h1. Valuing stories

Use a fibonacci sequence to value the stories.

# 1 point = low or questionable final value to users or stakeholders
# 2 points = some value - perhaps convenience, but not critical
# 3 points = high value, but not central nor a blocker
# 5 points = high value in and of itself OR is blocking another valuable feature
# 8 points = very high value in user satisfaction or revenue generation, other features should only # be pursued if they make this feature possible
